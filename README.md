# File Organizer <br />
A Python script that helps you organize files in a specified directory by grouping them based on their file extensions. The script will move files to corresponding folders (e.g., .jpg files go to a Images folder, .pdf files to a Documents folder) to keep your directory tidy. <br />

	&emsp;o Sorts and organizes files based on file extensions. <br />
	&emsp;o Automatically creates folders for each file type if they do not already exist. <br />
	&emsp;o Moves files to their corresponding folders. <br />
	&emsp;o Works with any directory on your system. <br />

**Technologies Used**  <br />
	&emsp;o Python <br />
	&emsp;o OS Module <br />
 
**Usage** <br />
The File Organizer GUI application allows you to easily sort files within a selected directory based on their file extensions. Follow the instructions below to use the GUI effectively. <br />
The script will create folders based on file extensions (e.g., Images, Documents, Music) and move the corresponding files into these folders. <br />


**Example:** <br />
Suppose you have the following files in a directory:  <br />
/Downloads<br />
├── vacation.jpg<br />
├── song.mp3<br />
├── report.pdf<br />
├── script.py<br />

Running the script will organize the files as follows:<br />
/Downloads <br />
├── Images<br />
│   └── vacation.jpg<br />
├── Music<br />
│   └── song.mp3<br />
├── Documents<br />
│   └── report.pdf<br />
├── Scripts<br />
│   └── script.py<br /><br /><br />
