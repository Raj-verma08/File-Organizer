**Usage** <br />
The File Organizer GUI application allows you to easily sort files within a selected directory based on their file extensions. Follow the instructions below to use the GUI effectively.
The script will create folders based on file extensions (e.g., Images, Documents, Music) and move the corresponding files into these folders.


**Example:** <br />
Suppose you have the following files in a directory:  <br />
/Downloads<br />
├── vacation.jpg<br />
├── song.mp3<br />
├── report.pdf<br />

Running the script will organize the files as follows:<br />
/Downloads <br />
├── Images<br />
│   └── vacation.jpg<br />
├── Music<br />
│   └── song.mp3<br />
├── Documents<br />
